                Paris, France's capital, is a major European city and a global center for art, fashion, gastronomy and
                culture. Its 19th-century cityscape is crisscrossed by wide boulevards and the River Seine. Beyond such
                landmarks as the Eiffel Tower and the 12th-century, Gothic Notre-Dame cathedral,
                the city is known for its cafe culture and designer boutiques along the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor√©s.
